          par_1: "Phil Carlisle first met Lama Ole Nydahl in 1995 at a public talk. The Lama's relaxed style and western approach inspired Phil to begin practising Diamond Way Buddhism in the Karma Kagyu Lineage of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. As a lay practitioner Phil runs a successful multimedia and web design business integrating his Buddhist practice with living and working in the modern world. In 2007 Lama Ole asked Phil to begin teaching Diamond Way Buddhism and spread these precious teachings as transparently as possible to idealistic clear-thinking Westerners."
          par_2: "Dr. Kenn Maly was born in Crofton, Nebraska, and studied phenomenological philosophy at Duquesne University, specializing in the work of Martin Heidegger. He is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, where he taught for nearly thirty years. He has translated numerous German books into English, including key texts of phenomenological philosophy and Buddhist texts. Most recently Kenn collaborated in the translation of Lama Ole Nydahl’s new book “Fearless Death: Buddhist Wisdom on the Art of Dying.” He brings his vast experience and expertise in phenomenology’s focus on interpreting experience together with his many years in Diamond Way Buddhism, both as Buddhist teacher and practitioner. He enjoys cooking!"
          par_3: "Rob Sok took Refuge in 1994 with Ole in Groningen (Netherlands). Teaching since: 2003. Occupation: After being part of some interesting research at universities, in 2009 we set up a company based on this research ('Lithicon'), doing service work for the gas and oil, and since then have worked for Lithicon in the research corner, as well as managing the data analysts. Country: Since 1999 I have lived with my wife Maike Brill in Canberra/Australia. Special interest: many and varied: mostly creative (painting, writing, etc), but also in business development, coaching etc."
